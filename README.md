# simple-hashing
Simple python script that allows a user to enter a string and hash it using 4 SHA hashing functions (sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512).

Makes use of the tkinter and hashlib libraries included in the Python Standard Libraries.

It was hastily cooked up so it's not particularly fancy - just made to help reinforce my knowledge of Python.
